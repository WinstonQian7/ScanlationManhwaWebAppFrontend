# Archived Project - The initial motivation was to build an site to allow users to track new chapter updates across different platforms. Project work was paused due to alternative solutions on the internet (e.g. comick, kenmai) that already solved this issue with an intuitive UI. 

# Technical Details
Site deployment in Vercel using Next.js + React + Typescript
Dependency management using npm + dependabot 
Web scrapers (undeployed) in Python using scrapy library
